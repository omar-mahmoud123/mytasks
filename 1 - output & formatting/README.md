# Output & Format

We learnt how to output in the **console** so far! and how to format numbers and calculations as well!
Let's use what we learnt.

**Open the [hello world.py](hello%20world.py) file with your code editor**

The task is to first of all print out `Hello world`.
Then print `I'm [your name]` 
After that print an empty line and follow that with a calculation

With the calculation itself in a string and calculat the solution with any formatting way you like.

> Good luck! :+1:
