## Tasks

### 1 - Password Checker

This is a simple task, just make a password saved in the code.  
Then make an input and check if they match, if so welcome the user, if not then tell them it's a wrong password.  

Build your app in [password-checker](password-checker.c)

#### for example:  

**wrong**  
![password wrong](assets/password-checker-wrong.png)  

**true**  
![password true](assets/password-checker-true.png)

### 2 - Make a Pattern Maker

What is pattern maker?  
- It's an app that you give a spesific number and it makes a pattern with that number  
for example:  
![pattern-example.png](assets/pattern-example.png)
