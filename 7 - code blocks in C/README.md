## Tasks

### Make you own app with C

**You'll make your own cli app in C this time.**  

But this time I'll let you decide what project **you** want to make  
so you'll make the project repo and **add the README** file with the idea of the app, and start right on with it.  
`Always consider making separating files and including them when needed.`

### Learn a new language

On this point you shall be ready to learn any language you want  
As we said, they all based on the same basics, so all it's about is the **syntax & the other features the language offers**.

The task is to learn a new language of your choise and document what you learnt in it and hand it over to the mintor.  

> Good luck
